			    	Hey, I've always been kind of anxious, I think, and sometimes I would get upset stomaches or feel like I'm going to throw up, or feel a heavy chest. Recently, things have gone a little more crazy.
					It started a few weeks ago. I got really severe pain in my abdomen right where my gal bladder would be (it was removed a few years back). I started freaking out and looking online for what it might be, which of course made me feel worse.
					After a couple of days, I went to the hospital, and they checked everything and couldn't find a reason. They suspected a muscle strain or something, and gave me some iboprofen and some antacid.

						You have to breathe because all of the cells in your body require oxygen. Without oxygen, your body wouldn't move. It would be like a parked car without no battery. The car might have gas, but without a battery, forget it! So you might have blood in your body, but without oxygen, forget it! 
						You receive oxygen from breathing in air and then the oxygen goes to your blood which is then circulated throughout your entire body.

						Deep breathing is a good way to calm down also we tend to live in the past or future we need to learn to live in the moment depression / anxiety can be caused by this but everyone is differant maybe you should google it there are some great websites hope this helps.
 						Depression is an odd thing to ask for advice on as most of those who offer their advice are sufferers and cannot help themselves. The best way to over come depression is to work out what is causing it and/or be proactive about improving your life and how you feel about yourself and your life.

						Of course it is not the best idea, but it will not cause a lot of harm is you exercise. I personally do that sometimes, when I am busy and don't get enough sleep. However, if this becomes your lifestyle, this is definitely not good for you,because you will cause more harm than good to your body and health. One time is ok, but not when it becomes a lifestyle.
